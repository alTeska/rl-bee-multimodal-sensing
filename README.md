# rl-bee-multimodal-sensing
Neuromatch group project: Relevance of sensory modalities for spatial navigation in foraging behaviours of the bee


## TODO model wise:
1. Testing different architectures
2. Reward testing 
   1. Adding senses
   2. Time passed punshiment
   3. wall hitting punishment
3. Increasing/gradually shrinking the goal size whilst training

## TODO code wise:
1. unit / functional testing 
2. stop training on no model improvement
3. advanced model saving and loading 
  - nice clean code
  - save only when improvement  
4. logger 
   


## TODO for more advanced experiments:
1. walls / obstacles
3. multiple goals
